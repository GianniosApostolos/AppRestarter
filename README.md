# AppRestarter

Restarting the same app over and over again must be exhausting. [This program](https://github.com/GianniosApostolos/AppRestarter/releases/latest) makes life easier for you !
You can choose which application you would like to restart and then restart it automatically with a click of a button.

Use it at your own risk. I bear no responsibility in case of potential damages or data loss.
